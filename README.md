# 20th-Century

## Project Overview 
Past events heavily influence the current geopolitical climate.  The goal of this project is to look at major global events of the 20th century and analyze the chain of events that led to current circumstances.  Interrelations between countries throughout the 20th century will be visualized.  Findings will inform research by the Institute for Public Policy.
